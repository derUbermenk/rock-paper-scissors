the program will do the ff:
	play a game, with 5 matches, until the last keep the score
	then evaluate who wins

	player chooses
	computer chooses


problems for support funcs:
	how do we get the computer to randomly choose -- ok
	how do we make the user choose 
	how do we evaluate which of the choices is greater than the other


problems for main func; the play game:






play game implementation:

	start at game 1; init scores to 1
	while the number of games is <= 5:
	play a match; evaluate  the current score of the player
	at termination of playgame, declare the winner


match implementation:
	inputs player choice, computer choice
	if equal, redo match -- else add 1 point to winner


computer choice implementation:
	given choices [Rock, Paper, Scissor]
	get a random index
	then return the choice as specified by random index

	getRandomInt is used a defn for choosing random index


make user choose:
	ask for a number - show counterparts at prompt
	convert that to int, then index

for this we can then store the choices to a top level array then do the indexing later




final pseudo code

define playgame
	matches played = 0
	while match played is <= 5
		play a match
	then return the winner + scores


define match
	inputs user choice, computer choice

	do conditional, left | right



	compare, + 1 to winner


define user choice
	prompt choose choice
	convert to integer
	get the choice as per index
	return the value

define computer choice
	choose a random int
	get the choice
	return the value

define evaluate               -- pano natin iiplement to -- OKS
	do conditionals
		paper beats rock
		rock beats scissor
		scissor beats paper

		paper -> rock win
		rock -> scissor win
		scissor -> paper win

		player only wins if (paper & rock || rock & scissor || scissor & paper) # only if this is true
		else computer wins
